## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bridgeai-doc-assistant.git
cd bridgeai-doc-assistant
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## üîê API Key Setup Instructions

Before running the app, you must generate your encrypted Gemini API key.

### üîß Step-by-Step

1. Run the following script to generate the necessary encryption files:

   ```bash
   python key_setup.py
   
The script will:
Prompt you to enter your Gemini API key
Generate two files:
```
fernet.key
encrypted_key.bin
```

These files are required at runtime and must be kept in the root project directory.
> Note: These files are intentionally excluded from Git version control via .gitignore for security reasons.

## üîê Security & .gitignore Notes

### üîí API Key Protection

- API keys are encrypted using **Fernet**.
- This project uses **AES-128-CBC encryption** with **HMAC-SHA256** integrity checks via `cryptography.fernet`.

### üìÇ .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file prevents sensitive and unnecessary files from being committed:

```gitignore
# Secrets & Config
.env
key_config.py

# Python Env & Cache
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# System & IDE
.DS_Store
.vscode/
.idea/
```

## üìä Analytics Capabilities

- **Descriptive Analytics (implemented):**  
  Auto-charting of Excel data, summary statistics, and keyword extraction.

- **Predictive Analytics (planned):**  
  Forecast trends from audit logs or document usage.

- **Prescriptive Analytics (planned):**  
  Recommend actions based on document patterns or triggers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- This version uses the **free Gemini API**, which is not suitable for production due to:
  - Rate limits
  - No enterprise-grade data retention guarantees

- Due to internship-level access, this was **not deployed on Bridgestone‚Äôs Microsoft Azure infrastructure** or internal SharePoint systems.

- Enterprise deployment should use **Azure OpenAI** or **on-prem LLMs** for secure integration.
