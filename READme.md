## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- This version uses the **free Gemini API**, which is not suitable for production due to:
  - Rate limits
  - No enterprise-grade data retention guarantees

- Due to internship-level access, this was **not deployed on Bridgestone‚Äôs Microsoft Azure infrastructure** or internal SharePoint systems.

- Enterprise deployment should use **Azure OpenAI** or **on-prem LLMs** for secure integration.
